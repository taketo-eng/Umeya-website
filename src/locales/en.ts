    desc: "Umeya was to be a café where people could gather in an old folk house that had been vacant according to the previous owner's plan. However, she passed away halfway through the project, and the plans came to a halt. About fifteen years after the house became vacant, we often visited Yame and interacted with the local people. One day, we heard about this old folk house and decided to make use of it, taking over the owner's desire to create a place for people to gather as she had envisioned at the time.Not only that, but the goodness of the people, the traditional architecture that lines the building, and the vast Yabe River behind Umeya also pushed us to get to know this Kurogi.",
